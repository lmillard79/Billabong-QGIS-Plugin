# Billabong QGIS Plugin - Development Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed information about the development process of the Billabong QGIS plugin, including the issues encountered, fixes implemented, and remaining tasks for future development.

## Development Process

### Initial Issues

1. **Dropdown Menu Not Populating**: The plugin's dropdown menu was not displaying any layers from the QLR file.
2. **Remote QLR File Fetching**: The plugin was attempting to fetch the QLR file from a remote URL that was returning a 404 error.
3. **QLR File Structure Parsing**: The QLR file had a complex nested structure that wasn't being parsed correctly.

### Fixes Implemented

#### 1. QLR File Loading Fix

- **Issue**: The plugin was trying to fetch the QLR file from a remote URL that didn't exist.
- **Solution**: Modified `billabong_config.py` to always use the local `billabong.qlr` file instead of fetching it remotely.
- **Files Modified**: `billabong_config.py`

#### 2. QLR File Parsing Improvements

- **Issue**: The QLR file parsing logic wasn't correctly identifying the "BILLABONG" group or parsing nested elements.
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `qlr_file.py` to properly find the "BILLABONG" group by name attribute.
  - Improved parsing of nested `<layer-tree-group>` and `<layer-tree-layer>` elements.
  - Enhanced extraction of layers with attributes like name, id, and service.
- **Files Modified**: `qlr_file.py`

#### 3. Menu Creation Logic Fix

- **Issue**: The menu creation logic wasn't handling empty or missing data correctly.
- **Solution**: Updated `billabong.py` to:
  - Only add groups with valid layers.
  - Skip empty categories, groups, and layers.
  - Only add group menus if they have actions.
- **Files Modified**: `billabong.py`

#### 4. QLR File Structure Fix

- **Issue**: The QLR file had multiple levels of nested groups which made parsing difficult.
- **Solution**: Restructured the QLR file to have a flatter structure for easier parsing.
- **Files Modified**: `billabong.qlr`

#### 5. Icon Update

- **Issue**: The plugin was using an outdated icon.
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `resources.qrc` to use `img/WRM_DROPLET.png` as the main icon.
  - Updated `metadata.txt` to reference the new icon path.
  - Regenerated `resources.py` using `pyrcc5`.
- **Files Modified**: `resources.qrc`, `metadata.txt`, `resources.py`

#### 6. Repository Cleanup

- **Issue**: The repository contained unnecessary files.
- **Solution**: Removed `List of Layers.txt` and `qlr_last_modified.txt` which were no longer needed.
- **Files Removed**: `List of Layers.txt`, `qlr_last_modified.txt`

## Testing Process

### Debugging Steps

1. Added extensive logging in QGIS message log to debug QLR parsing and menu creation.
2. Created debug versions of the plugin (`Billabong_fixed_plugin_v5_debug.zip`, `Billabong_fixed_plugin_v6_debug.zip`) with enhanced logging.
3. Checked QGIS Log Messages panel for "Billabong" plugin logs to verify parsing and menu creation steps.
4. Verified that the menu populates correctly and layers can be loaded.

### Testing Results

After implementing all the fixes:
- The dropdown menu now correctly displays layers from the QLR file.
- Layers can be successfully loaded into the QGIS map canvas.
- The plugin functions as intended within QGIS.

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling

- Implement more robust error handling for network issues when accessing online map services.
- Add user-friendly error messages for common issues.

### 2. Performance Improvements

- Optimize QLR file parsing for better performance with large files.
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed layers.

### 3. User Interface Enhancements

- Add a search functionality to quickly find layers.
- Implement layer preview functionality.
- Add layer metadata display.

### 4. Configuration Options

- Add user preferences for default layer styling.
- Implement options for automatic layer updates.
- Add support for user-defined layer groups.

### 5. Documentation Improvements

- Create detailed user manual with screenshots.
- Develop API documentation for developers.
- Add troubleshooting guide for common issues.

### 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

- Implement automated tests for plugin functionality.
- Conduct compatibility testing with different QGIS versions.
- Perform performance testing with large datasets.

## Future Development Considerations

### 1. Additional Data Sources

- Integrate more Australian government data sources.
- Add support for international flood and rainfall data.
- Implement data filtering by date range.

### 2. Advanced Features

- Add layer comparison functionality.
- Implement time-series data visualization.
- Add export functionality for layer data.

### 3. Integration with Other Tools

- Develop integration with other WRM tools and services.
- Add support for cloud-based data storage.

## Technical Details

### Plugin Architecture

The Billabong plugin follows a modular architecture:

1. **Main Plugin Class** (`billabong.py`): Handles plugin initialization, menu creation, and layer loading.
2. **Configuration Management** (`billabong_config.py`, `config.py`, `local_config.py`): Manages plugin configuration and layer definitions.
3. **QLR File Parsing** (`qlr_file.py`): Parses the QGIS Layer Definition file to extract layer information.
4. **Constants** (`constants.py`): Defines plugin constants and URLs.
5. **UI Components** (`settings/`): Contains dialog UI files and related code.
6. **Resources** (`resources.py`, `resources.qrc`): Manages plugin icons and other resources.

### Dependencies

- PyQt5
- QGIS Python API
- Qt XML DOM (`QtXml.QDomDocument`)

### Supported QGIS Versions

- Minimum: QGIS 3.18
- Tested: QGIS 3.40.8
