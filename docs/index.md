# About Billabong

Billabong is a QGIS plugin for visualising Australian flood and rainfall data. It gives quick access to a variety of feature sets and map layers provided by Geoscience Australia, the Google Maps Platform and OpenStreetMap. Selecting a desired layer from the Billabong menu will add it to the map canvas with styling and labelling applied. The layers are provided via WMS, WFS, WMTS and XYZ services, which all require an active internet connection.  

This manual will guide you through the installation, configuration and use of the plugin.
