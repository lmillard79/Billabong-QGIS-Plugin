# Introduction

AusMap is a QGIS plugin for visualising publicly available Australian geographic data. It gives quick access to a variety of feature sets and map layers provided by Geoscience Australia, the Google Maps Platform and OpenStreetMap. Selecting a desired layer from the AusMap menu will add it to the map canvas with styling and labelling applied. The layers are provided via WMS, WFS, WMTS and XYZ services, which all require an active internet connection.  

This manual will guide you through the installation, configuration and use of the plugin.
