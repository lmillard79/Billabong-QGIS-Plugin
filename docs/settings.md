# Settings

The Billabong plugin can be extended with additional map layers for easy access.  
The map layers must be saved in a Layer Definition File (.QLR).  

The .QLR file must match the Billabong menu layout, meaning that the map layers must be grouped into one or more categories.  

See the example below.

## Example

The *Additional layers* are grouped into two categories.

![Grouped map layers](/assets/images/grouped-layers.png)

Save the layers in a .QLR file by selecting the groups, right-clicking, and choosing **Export** > **Save as Layer Definition File**.

![Save QLR](/assets/images/save-qlr.png)

Navigate to the Billabong page in the Options dialog (**Settings** > **Options** > **Billabong**), select the .QLR file from your local machine and click **OK**.  

![Billabong options dialog](/assets/images/options-dialog.png)

The additional map layers will now appear in their respective groups inside the Billabong menu.

To remove the layers from the menu, go back to the Options dialog, delete the file path and save.
